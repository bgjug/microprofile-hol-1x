== Health Check

Monitoring a microservice application is not like monitoring a monolith.
There are system with tens or even hundreds of microservices, each of which can stop working.
Or can still be up, but not functioning properly and might need some attention (or a simple restart).
It should be possible for a centralized monitoring tool or an orchestrator (like Kubernates) to be able to tell at every moment whether a service is healthy or not.

The purpose of the MicroProfile Health Check spec is to define a way to determine exactly that.
Each compliant implementation should expose the `/health` resource.
Based on its outcome, it should be possible to identify whether a microservice is doing well or not.

Obviously, if that resource is not available, then the service is down and should be started.
However, there might be some cases, when the service is up, but is not functioning correctly.
In these cases health endpoint should suggest that by returning a 503 HTTP response code and by providing the details in the response body.

In this chapter we will show you how you can use MicroProfile Health Check to provide that information in a straightforward manner.

=== The _health_ resource

Let's try to do a health check of the _users_ microservice.
Make sure that it is running (call the `startUsers.sh` or `startUsers.bat` script) and then access http://localhost:9100/health.
It should return the following response content:

[source,json]
----
{
    "outcome":"UP",
    "checks":[]
}
----

There are two important attributes in this response body: `outcome` and `checks`.
The first one provides the overall result of the health check.
If everything with the checks implemented by the microservices is fine, the outcome is `"UP"`.
Otherwise it would be `"DOWN"`.

But what are these checks?
Initially there are no such, that is why the `checks` attribute's value is an empty array.
But the Health Checks specification provides a standard API which allows to implement and plug user defined checks.
If any of it returns a bad status, the overall outcome becomes `"DOWN"`.
If *all* the checks are fine, then you'll get the `"UP"` result.

=== Implementing a check

You can easily define your own health checks by implementing the `org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck` interface.
It defines a single method `call`, which returns an instance of `HealthCheckResponse`.
In a CDI managed environment like those in our sample application, you can automatically register that by annotating it with `org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Health`.

Let's add together a few health checks to the _subscribers_ microservice.
Suppose that it should be considered live if it can access the _users_ microservice.
Otherwise, if for some reason it can't, it should report that it is not healthy and hope that a restart by the orchestrating program will fix the issue.
We'll start by adding this class in the `bg.jug.microprofile.hol.subscribers` package:

[source,java]
----
@Health
@ApplicationScoped
public class UserAvailabilityHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {

    }
}
----

We'll try to access the users microservice and build the response based on its availability.
The `HealthCheckResponse` class defines a builder-like API.
You bootstrap it by calling the `named()` method and thus providing a name to distinguish your check in the JSON object.

[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        HealthCheckResponseBuilder response = HealthCheckResponse.named("usersAvailable");

    }
----

Then, based on the outcome you want to communicate, you either call `up()` or `down()`.
In our case it depends on the result of the HTTP call to the users microservice:

[source,java]
----
    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "usersServiceUrl", defaultValue = "http://localhost:9100/users")
    private String usersUrl;

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        HealthCheckResponseBuilder response = HealthCheckResponse.named("usersAvailable");

        Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
        try {
            client.target(usersUrl)
                    .path("all")
                    .request()
                    .get();
            return response.up().build();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            return response.down().build();
        }

    }
----

So, that's it.
Let's try it out.
Make sure that both the _subscribers_ and _users_ microservices are running (for subscribers you can kill it and start it again with the respective script after each change you do to the app) and access http://localhost:9130/health.
You should receive something along these lines:

[source,json]
----
{
    "outcome":"UP",
    "checks":[
        {
            "name":"usersAvailable",
            "state":"UP",
            "data":{}
        }
    ]
}
----

Stop the users microservice and see how the outcome changes to `"DOWN"`.

=== Providing additional data

The `HealthCheckResponseBuilder` API gives you the opportunity to provide some more information about each check.
It will appear in the `data` attribute of the respective check in the response JSON.
Let's try this.
Suppose we want to have a check whether the number of subscribers has reached a certain value.
Beyond that value we will consider our microservice as overloaded and raise a flag to the team responsible for monitoring the magazine manager.

There is nothing peculiar in creating this health check.
We will make the maximum number of subscribers configurable, so that we can play around wit it.

[source,java]
----
@Health
@ApplicationScoped
public class SubscribersListFullCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "maxSubscribers", defaultValue = "10")
    private int maximumSubscribers;

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {

    }
}
----

In order to implement the `call` method we will need to inject `SubscribersRepository`.
We will use it to extract the number of subscribers and then will compare the latter to the maximum number coming from the configuration:

[source,java]
----
    @Inject
    private SubscribersRepository subscribersRepository;

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        int numberOfSubscribers = subscribersRepository.getSubscribers().size();
        return HealthCheckResponse.named("subscribersListFull")
                .state(numberOfSubscribers <= maximumSubscribers) (1)
                .build();
    }
----

(1) Besides the `up` and `down` methods, the `HealthCheckResponseBuilder` class provides a `state` method that takes a boolean.
It is much more convenient in cases where we want to evaluate the health check condition.
There this method saves us some if's and else's

Finally we want to add some context information about the check in the `data` attribute.
We do it with the `withData()` method, which takes a key and a value.
For each `withData()` method call the response method will append an attribute to the `data` object:

[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        int numberOfSubscribers = subscribersRepository.getSubscribers().size();
        return HealthCheckResponse.named("subscribersListFull")
                .withData("Number of subscribers", numberOfSubscribers)
                .withData("Maximum subscriber", maximumSubscribers)
                .state(numberOfSubscribers <= maximumSubscribers)
                .build();
    }
----

Now if we try to access again the health check endpoint, we'll get this:

[source,json]
----
{
    "outcome":"UP",
    "checks":[
        {
            "name":"subscribersListFull",
            "state":"UP",
            "data":
                {
                    "Number of subscribers":"3",
                    "Maximum subscriber":"10"
                }
        },
        {
            "name":"usersAvailable",
            "state":"UP",
            "data":{}
        }
    ]
}
----

Try a little bit experimenting.
Set the maximum subscribers (e.g. by setting an environment variable called `maxSubscribers`) to 1 and restart the subscribers microservice.
See what happened to the new health check that we added and to the overall outcome.
