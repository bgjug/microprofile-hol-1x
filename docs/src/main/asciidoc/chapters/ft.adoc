== Fault Tolerance

Microservice applications are not like monoliths.
No matter how complex a monolith is, no matter of how many modules it may consist, inter-module communications are just method calls.
Which are fairly predictable whether they will succeed or not.
On the other hand, one of the main characteristics of microservice applications is that they are distributed.
In distributed apps calls between different modules (or microservices) go over the wire.
And the most reliable thing about a network call is that it is not reliable.

That is why, in order to not fail in a distributed environment, we must be ready to embrace failure.
And be tolerant to faults by handling them gracefully.
Or in other words - be resilient.
Throughout the last few years a lot of patterns were defined.
They later became best practices in the area of fault tolerance in a microservice architecture.
There were also libraries (https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix[Hystrix] and https://github.com/jhalterman/failsafe[Failsafe] to name a few) that provided Java developers the toolset to implement those patterns in their apps.

MicroProfile implementations make no difference in their goal to provide those capabilities.
In the following lines we will look at which those fault tolerance patterns are and how you can make your MicroProfile app use them.
We will use the _content_ service, in conjunction with _authors_ for demo.
When the former is requested to return a certain article, it in turns requests the author details (like first and last name and short bio) from the latter.
This call may fail for many different reasons and you'll see how MicroProfile Fault Tolerance features allow you to handle failure gracefully.

=== Timeout

One of the nastiest things for a user of a website is waiting a page to load for too long.
The time of modems is long gone and now even smart phones are able to load the website content really fast.
But sometimes the microservice serving our page might be calling another service, which might be performing a bit slow.
So we must be able to set a minimum time after which the call will be abandoned.

Doing that is quite straightforward with MicroProfile Fault Tolerance.
This and all the other resilience configurations can be enabled by just adding an annotation.
In this case it is `org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Timeout`.
It receives a value, which is the time (by default in milliseconds, but the time unit can be configured) to wait for the method call to return.

You can place this annotation on method or on class level.
In the latter case, it will apply to all the methods in the annotated class.

Let's see how we can configure the _content_ microservice to wait at most 800 milliseconds for the _authors_ microservice to return.
We have the `AuthorClient` bean that does the communication, so let's annotate its `findAuthorByEmail` method:

[source,java]
----
    @Timeout(800)
    public JsonObject findAuthorByEmail(String email) {
        // Method implementation
    }
----

Quick and easy.

In order to simulate failure, let's add an artificial sleep in `AuthorsResource::findAuthorById`:

[source,java]
----
    @GET
    @Path("/findByEmail/{email}")
    public Response findAuthorById(@PathParam("email") String email) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        return authorsRepository.findAuthorByEmail(email)
                .map(author -> Response.ok(author.toJson()).build())
                .orElse(Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build());
    }
----

Run the _content_ and _authors_ microservices and call http://localhost:9120/content/findById/3.

Well, nothing really exciting happened: we eventually got a `TimeoutException` in the console.
We can all agree that reporting the failure is not the most resilient outcome.
In order to fail gracefully you have to return anything.

Enter `@Fallback`.

=== Fallback

Resilience doesn't mean reporting errors.
It mostly means always responding, even in case of failure.
That is why MicroProfile Fault Tolerance implementations provide the `org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Fallback` annotation.
It helps you declare a fallback class or method, which will be called in case of failure.

Let's declare one in conjunction with our timeout:

[source,java]
----
    @Fallback(fallbackMethod = "defaultAuthor") <1>
    @Timeout(800)
    public JsonObject findAuthorByEmail(String email) {
        // method implementation
    }

    public JsonObject defaultAuthor(String email) { <2>
        return Json.createObjectBuilder()
                .add("firstName", "")
                .add("lastName", "Unkown")
                .add("bio", "Try again later")
                .add("email", email)
                .build();
    }
----

<1> Declare the name of the fallback method, which will be called in case `findAuthorByEmail` times out
<2> Implement the fallback method. It should be in the same class as the original method and should have the same parameters and return type

Sometime you want to use the same fallback behavior for multiple methods located in different classes.
In that case you can define that behavior in a separate class, implementing the `FallbackHandler` interface.
And pass that implementation to the value attribute of the `@Fallback` annotation:

[source,java]
----
    @Fallback(AuthorMissingFallbackHandler.class)
    @Timeout(800)
    public JsonObject findAuthorByEmail(String email) {
        // Implementation goes here
    }

public class AuthorMissingFallbackHandler
            implements FallbackHandler<JsonObject> {

    @Override
    public JsonObject handle(ExecutionContext executionContext) {
        return Json.createObjectBuilder()
                .add("firstName", "")
                .add("lastName", "Unkown")
                .add("bio", "Try again later")
                .add("email", (String) executionContext.getParameters()[0])
                .build();
    }
}
----

=== Retry

One of the most common situations in a distributed system is when a microservice is down for a reason.
In a lot of these cases, it gets restarted by the orchestration/monitoring tool immediately after it discovers the problem.
That is why a common pattern when a request fails is to repeat that request, hoping that the service will be available the next time.

This can be easily done with MicroProfile Fault Tolerance.
You just use the annotation `org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Retry`.
In order to avoid constant retries when the failure is not that easily recoverable (i.e. a simple restart of the remote service is not a solution), you can configure things like maximum number of retries, or maximum time when retries are performed.

Let's do that with our `AuthorClient`.
We will set `@Retry` there and specify that the maximum number of retries is 5.
If you ommit that, the default is 3.
Let's also add a dump in the console to note that the method was called (so that we verify the retry functionality).

[source,java]
----
    @Retry(maxRetries = 5)
    @Fallback(AuthorMissingFallbackHandler.class)
    public JsonObject findAuthorByEmail(String email) {
        System.out.println("Looking up author");
        Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
        Response response = client.target(authorsUrl).path("findByEmail/" + email)
                .request(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE)
                .get();
        JsonObject author = response.readEntity(JsonObject.class);
        response.close();
        return author;
    }
----

You also noticed that we still keep our fallback handler.
It will be invoked in case that after the specified number of retries, the failure keeps occurring.

Now, in order to see the fallback and retry in action, let's start the _user_, _gui_ and _content_ microservices (and stop _author_).
Go to http://localhost:9000 and log in with any registered user (e.g. frodo@example.org/frodo123).
Then pick an article and click on its title.

You'll notice two things:

. Our default author was displayed in the article page
. The content microservice console printed six times the dump message we added

The `@Retry` annotation provides quite a few options for configuring the retry policy

* Delay between retries (default is 0)
* Exceptions which will trigger retry
* Exceptions which will trigger abort
* Jitter

=== Circuit breaker

You can regard the _circuit breaker_ as retry on steroids.
The pattern was popularized by Michael Nygard in his book Release It! in 2012.

The idea behind the pattern is that there must be a circuit breaker object that intercepts the call to a given resource.
This object looks for failures and once those failures reach a certain threshold, the "circuit opens".
Which means that the interceptor will return an error (or a fallback response) for some time.
After that time passes, the circuit becomes half-open.
While in this state, if the next request succeeds, the circuit closes and the communication continues in its intended mode.
Otherwize, the circuit goes back to open and stays like that for another timeout period.

It is fairly easy to configure a circuit breaker for method calls with MicroProfile Fault Tolerance.
There is again a dedicated annotation: `org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.CircuitBreaker`.
Here is the same method in the `AuthorClient` class, this time protected by a circuit breaker:

[source,java]
----
    @CircuitBreaker(requestVolumeThreshold = 10, <1>
                    failureRatio = 0.6, <2>
                    delay = 2000L, <3>
                    successThreshold = 2 <4>
                )
    @Fallback(AuthorMissingFallbackHandler.class) <5>
    public JsonObject findAuthorByEmail(String email) {
        // Method implementation
    }
----

<1> The circuit breaker will monitor a rolling window of 10 method calls
<2> If a ratio of 0.6 of those 10, that is 6, fail, the circuit will open
<3> The circuit will stay open for 2000 ms.
If there are no failures in that period, it will go to half open state.
<4> If during the half-open state there are two successful method calls, the circuit will be closed
<5> While the circuit is open, a fallback response will be returned

=== Asynchronous

In the world of internet there is no time to wait.
Besides resilient, another feature of the microservices apps is *reactive*.
First step to becoming reactive is to avoid waiting for long running operations and only show their result when it is ready.

Let's look again at our magazine manager.
Suppose that adding a new article takes more than a couple of seconds.
We will simulate that with an artificial sleep in the beginning of the ArticleRepository::createOrUpdate method:

[source,java]
----
    public void createOrUpdate(Article article) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        articles.put(article.getId(), article);
    }
----

Restart the _content_ microserive after this change and try adding a new article in the UI.
You will notice the delay.
It is not the greatest experience, is it?

But we can make the above method asynchronous.
Thus it will return immediately.
When we add a new article, the main page will load.
Yes, it will miss our article at first load, but there are more than a few techniques in modern web design to handle that.
Just waiting on the "Add article" page is certainly not one of them.

So, how do we make the above method call asynchronous:

[source,java]
----
    @Asynchronous <1>
    public Future<Void> createOrUpdate(Article article) { <2>
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        articles.put(article.getId(), article);
        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null); <3>
    }
----

<1> Annotate the method with `org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Asynchronous`.
Remember EJB 3? :)
<2> The method should return `Future` now instead of `void`
<3> Yes, the method should return `Future` even though we don't care about the result.
And this is one way to build a `Future<Void>`

Restart the _content_ microservice (make sure that _gui_ and _users_ are running).
Add an article.
You will see immediately the articles list pages, but your new article won't be there.
Wait for a couple of seconds and click refresh.
Your article should appear.

=== Bulkhead

Another useful pattern coming from the Release it! book.
Its goal is to avoid faults that occur in one part of a system to take the entire system down.
MicroProfile Fault Tolerance (as well as Hystrix) achieves that goal by limiting the number of concurrent calls to a method.
This way there is no way the execution of a certain method to hijack all the resources (e.g. threads for request handling) that might be needed by other methods.

You may certainly guess that there is an annotation to set up Bulkhead: `org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Bulkhead`.
As well as in Hystrix, there are two approaches to bulkhead in MicroProfile Fault Tolerance: thread pool isolation and semaphore isolation.

When applied to asynchronous method calls, the thread pool isolation is used.
It allows to configure maximum concurrent threads size as well as the size of the waiting queue.
Here is an example with our `ArticleRepository::createOrUpdate` method:

[source,java]
----
    @Asynchronous
    @Bulkhead(value = 5, <1>
              waitingTaskQueue = 8 <2>
          )
    public Future<Void> createOrUpdate(Article article) {
        // Method implementation
    }
----

<1> The maximum number of concurrent threads
<2> The waiting queue size

The approach to synchronous calls is semaphore style.
It only allows to configure the number of concurrent calls:

[source,java]
----
    @GET
    @Path("/findById/{id}")
    @Bulkhead(5)
    public Response findArticleById(@PathParam("id") Long id) {
        // Find the articles
    }
----
