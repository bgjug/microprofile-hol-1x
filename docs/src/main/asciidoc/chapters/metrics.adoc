== Metrics

Reliable service of a platform needs monitoring.
There is already JMX as standard to expose metrics, but remote-JMX is not easy to deal with and especially does not fit well in a polyglot environment where other services are not running on the JVM.
To enable monitoring in an easy fashion it is necessary that all MicroProfile implementations follow a certain standard with respect to (base) API path, data types involved, always available metrics and return codes used.

=== Difference to health checks
Health checks are primarily targeted at a quick yes/no response to the question "Is my application still running ok?". Modern systems that schedule the starting of applications (e.g. Kubernetes) use this information to restart the application if the answer is 'no'.

Metrics on the other hand can help to determine the health. Beyond this they serve to pinpoint issues, provide long term trend data for capacity planning and pro-active discovery of issues (e.g. disk usage growing without bounds). Metrics can also help those scheduling systems decide when to scale the application to run on more or fewer machines.

=== Metrics Setup
Metrics that are exposed need to be configured in the server. On top of the pure metrics, metadata needs to be provided.

The following three sets of sub-resource (scopes) are exposed.

* base: metrics that all MicroProfile vendors have to provide
* vendor: vendor specific metrics (optional)
* application: application-specific metrics (optional)

Let us try to see those metrics since they are already available at the server start.
Make sure that the _subscribers_ service is running and access:

`http://localhost:9130/metrics`

You will see something like:

# TYPE vendor:system_cpu_load gauge
# HELP vendor:system_cpu_load Display the "recent cpu usage" for the whole system. This value is a double in the [0.0,1.0] interval. A value of 0.0 means that all CPUs were idle during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. All values betweens 0.0 and 1.0 are possible depending of the activities going on in the system. If the system recent cpu usage is not available, the method returns a negative value.

You may try with `http://localhost:9130/metrics/base` and `http://localhost:9130/metrics/vendor` as well..

By default th output is in Prometheus format. But the output can be in JSON format as well. To have in JSON we have to add header "Accept: application/json" to our request. If you do not put any header, the server will recognize it as text and return the metrics in Prometheus format.

=== Gathering the metrics
The easiest way is to annotate field, method or class with an annotation.

|===
|Annotation	|Applies to	|Description	|Default Unit

|@Counted
|M, C, T
|Denotes a counter, which counts the invocations of the annotated object.
|MetricUnits.NONE

|@Gauge
|M
|Denotes a gauge, which samples the value of the annotated object.
|none Must be supplied by the user

|@Metered
|M, C, T
|Denotes a meter, which tracks the frequency of invocations of the annotated object.
|MetricUnits.PER_SECOND

|@Metric
|M, F, P
|An annotation that contains the metadata information when requesting a metric to be injected or produced. This annotation can be used on fields of type Meter, Timer, Counter, and Histogram. For Gauge, the @Metric annotation can only be used on producer methods/fields.
|MetricUnits.NONE

|@Timed
|M, C, T
|Denotes a timer, which tracks duration of the annotated object.
|MetricUnits.NANOSECONDS

|===

The programming API follows http://metrics.dropwizard.io/[Dropwizard] Metrics 3.2.3 API, but with local changes. It is expected that many existing DropWizard Metrics based applications can easily be ported over by exchanging the package names.


==== Counters
Counters are a metric that is used to keep an incremental or a decremental count. The initial value of the counter is set to 0 and can be incremented by using inc() or inc(long n) and decremented by using dec() or dec(long n).

You can use a counter to count total number of requests that are received or total number of concurrently active HTTP sessions.

==== Gauges
Gauges represent metrics that are sampled to obtain their value.

We will see detailed examples below.

==== Meters
Meters are used to track throughput.

To use a meter, you must call the meter.mark() method to mark an event. For multiple events, you can also use mark(long n) to mark multiple occurrences of events at the same time. A meter provides the following information:

* Mean throughput.
* One/five/fifteen minute exponentially weighted moving average throughput.
* A count of the number of measurements.

==== Histograms
Histograms are used to store the distribution of values.

To record a value in the histogram, you must call histogram.update(long value) with the value that you want to record. The current state (or snapshot) of the histogram can be retrieved by using getSnapshot(). Histograms in MicroProfile Metrics only support integer or long values.

A histogram provides the following information:

* Max/Min/Mean values
* The value at the 50th, 75th, 95th, 98th, 99th, 99.9th percentile
* A count of the number of values


==== Timers
Timers are used to aggregate timing durations, in nanoseconds, and provide duration and throughput statistics.

To time a portion of the code, you can call timer.time(), which returns a timer.context object. This context is used to stop the timer by calling context.close(). The information that is retrieved from the timer is a combination of a meter and a histogram of timed durations.

A timer provides the following information:

* Max/Min/Mean times.
* The time value at the 50th, 75th, 95th, 98th, 99th, 99.9th percentile.
* Mean throughput.
* One/five/fifteen minute exponentially weighted moving average throughput.
* A count of the number of timed events.


=== In our case

Let us implement some of the metrics for our particular cases.

==== Metered
The easiest example will be to add one @Metered annotation to a method to monitor how often it has been called.
Lets switch to `SubscribersResource`

[source, java]
----
@POST
@Path("/add")
@Metered(name = "Subscriber added")
public Response addSubscriber(String subscriberString) {
----

Before we can test the new metrics we need to call at least one time the `Subscribers` service. For that purpose lets run `curl http://localhost:9130/subscribers/all`.
Now let us run `curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:9130/metrics`. We will see the following JSON:

[source,json]
----
...
"application": {
    "bg.jug.microprofile.hol.subscribers.SubscribersRepository.Subscriber added": {
      "count": 0,
      "fiveMinRate": 0.0,
      "oneMinRate": 0.0,
      "fifteenMinRate": 0.0,
      "meanRate": 0.0
    },
...
----

==== Gauge

Let us also observe the state of our DB.
A good idea is to use a gauge in `SubscribersRepository`:

[source, java]
----
@Gauge(name = "Subscribers DB usage", unit = MetricUnits.NONE, absolute = true)
public int getDBUsage(){
   return subscribers.size();
}
----

Now if we go to metrics we will see:

[source]
----
...
# TYPE application:subscribers_db_usage gauge
application:subscribers_db_usage 3
...
----

Currently we don't need any specific metric unit so we use NONE.

==== Counter

The API provides us the infrastructure for various counters.
Let's implement it on the subscribers.

First we will inject it in `SubscribersRepository`

[source, java]
----
@Inject
@Metric
private Counter subscribersDBCounter;
----

Now we are able to use it in the code:

[source, java]
----
public void addSubscriber(Subscriber subscriber) {
    subscribers.put(subscriber.getEmail(), subscriber);
    //used for metrics
    subscribersDBCounter.inc();
}
----

As a result we can observe it in `http://localhost:9130/metrics`

[source]
----
# TYPE application:bg_jug_microprofile_hol_subscribers_subscribers_repository_subscribers_db_counter counter
application:bg_jug_microprofile_hol_subscribers_subscribers_repository_subscribers_db_counter 3
----

==== MetricRegistry

The MetricRegistry is used to maintain a collection of metrics along with their metadata. There is one shared singleton of the MetricRegistry per scope (application, base, and vendor). When metrics are registered using annotations, the metrics are registered in the application MetricRegistry (and thus the application scope).

We can gain programmatic access to all our counters from the registry like this: first `@Inject` it to our class

[source,java]
----
@Inject
private MetricRegistry registry;
----

then see what we have:

[source,java]
----
@PostConstruct
private void init(){
    ...
    registry.getGauges();
    System.out.println("Log all gauges:" +registry.getGauges());
    System.out.println("Log all counters:" +registry.getCounters());
    ...
}
----

we can not only see our meters, but also register new ones with MetricRegistry. This is done in the example below.

Looks great!

==== Custom Gauge
Now let us switch to _content_ service.
We would like to know what is the currently most published author. Let us do this via a custom `Gauge` and `MetricRegistry`.

Gauges represent metrics that are sampled to obtain their value.

A gauge is an interface that needs to be implemented by the developer. Since the implementation of a gauge is not defined, they must be manually registered with the MetricRegistry by using the MetricRegistry .register() method.

. First of all, let's inject the registry in `ArticleRepository`

[source,java]
----
@Inject
private MetricRegistry metricRegistry;
----
[start=2]
. Then in the `@PostConstruct` method add our custom gauge, its metadata and register it. The Gauge is actually just an implementation of a functional interface, so we can implement it with just a lambda. Inside this lambda we are searching for an Author, identified by his email, who wrote the greatest count of articles. First we group by email to find count, then we select the email which has the greatest count:

[source,java]
----
//metrics, searching for the most published author
Gauge<String> theMostPublishedAuthor = () -> {
    Map<String, Long> articlesPerAuthor = articles.values().stream()
                .map(Article::getAuthor)
                .collect(groupingBy(Function.identity(), Collectors.counting()));
    return Collections.max(articlesPerAuthor.entrySet(),
                Comparator.comparingLong(Map.Entry::getValue)).getKey();
};
----

[start=3]
. We then have to add the details describing our gauge. This is done

[source,java]
----
Metadata mostPublishedMetadata = new Metadata(
        "theMostPublishedAuthor",
        "The Most Published Author",
        "The Most Published Author so far",
        MetricType.GAUGE,
        MetricUnits.NONE);

metricRegistry.register(mostPublishedMetadata, theMostPublishedAuthor);
----

[start=4]
. Now if we start the service (startContent.sh or startContent.bat) and run from the command line

[source]
----
curl -k -u theUser:thePassword -H "Accept: application/json" https://localhost:9999/metrics/application
----

We will see:

[source,json]
----
{
  "theMostPublishedAuthor":"frodo@example.org"
}
----

as a result! Great!
